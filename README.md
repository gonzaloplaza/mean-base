# MEAN Base
![Logo of the project](http://ordermin.com/images/mean-logo.jpg)

**MEAN Base** is an open source project designed and assembled to build simple web applications based in MEAN fullstack architecture: MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, Node.Js

  - (**M**)ongoDB is the leading NoSQL database, empowering businesses to be more agile and scalable.
  - (**E**)xpress is a minimal and flexible node.js web application framework, providing a robust set of features for building single and multi-page, and hybrid web applications.
  - (**A**)ngularJS lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop.
  - (**N**)ode.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications.

### Prerequisites
You'll need the following technologies and packages installed on your PC (Windows, Linux) or Mac. Please read the custom documentation for each platform.

- Node.js v4.x + npm: Check [documentation](https://nodejs.org/)
- MongoDB 3.4.x : Check [documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/#mongodb-community-edition)
- Bower 1.8.x : check [documentation](https://bower.io/#install-bower)
- Nodemon : check [documentation](https://nodemon.io) 

### Installation
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/gonzaloplaza/mean-base.git my-project
$ cd my-project
$ npm install && bower install
$ node bin/setup
$ nodemon bin/www
```

Without closing your terminal, you can check the project running at **http://localhost:8080**

For production environments.. (pending)


### Configuration

You can configure the main App parameters such as database host, user, application name and others in **development.js** file. 
This file is auto-generated by ***setup*** script for the development environment. You can update it and add new config values.
```
{
    "app": {
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "name": "Application Name",
      "author": "Author Name",
      "email": "foo@bar.com"
    },
    "db": {
      "host": "127.0.0.1",
      "port": 27017,
      "user": "",
      "password": "",
      "name": "mean-test"
    },
    "mailer": {
      "host": "smtp.provider.com",
      "port": 587,
      "transport": "smtp",
      "encryption": "ssl",
      "secure": true,
      "auth": {
        "user": "",
        "password": ""
      },
      "sender": "foo@bar.com"
    }
}
```

### Troubleshooting
If you find any issue running the application, check if Node.js, Npm (Node Package Manager), Bower and Nodemon are installed in your system and updated.
> Note: This packages are compatible with many OS and architectures
> (Windows, Linux, Mac), please check the documentation related to your
> system and follow instructions.

```sh
$ sudo npm cache clean -f
$ sudo npm install -g n
$ sudo n stable
$ sudo npm install bower -g
$ sudo npm install nodemon -g
```

Check if your MongoDB service is installed and running.
```sh
$ sudo service mongod status|start|restart
```

Create and give write permission to cache/logs folders:
```sh
$ mkdir var/cache var/logs
$ chmod -R 777 var/cache var/logs
```

Without closing the terminal, check the application log messages. It should display the following message after starting (or error description):
```sh
$ nodemon bin/www
---- Mean Base Application version 1.0.0 ----
Server INITIALIZED listening on port: 8080
NODE_ENV Environment: development
Mongoose default connection open: localhost:27017/mean-test
```
